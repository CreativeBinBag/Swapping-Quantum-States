This project simulates a quantum computing game where the goal is to swap the states of quantum bits (qubits) that are arranged in a specific pattern. Unlike regular computer bits that are either 0 or 1, these qubits exist in quantum states that have special mathematical properties. The challenge is that in this layout, not all qubits are directly connected to each otherâ€”some can only interact with their immediate neighbors. The code demonstrates how to exchange the information between any two qubits by finding a path through connected qubits and using special quantum operations called CNOT gates to perform the swap. This mimics real-world quantum computers where physical limitations prevent direct interactions between distant qubits, requiring clever algorithms to move quantum information around the system.

I have added notes and visual examples in the notebook for clearer understanding.
