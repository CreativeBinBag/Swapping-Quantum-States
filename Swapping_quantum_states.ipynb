    "### Why the Fix Step is Necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why we need step 5 (directly setting the endpoint values) when we've already swapped along the path. There are two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision Issues**: Quantum operations can accumulate numerical errors. Direct assignment ensures the exact values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fixing Intermediate States**: The neighbor swaps might affect intermediate qubits in unintended ways. For instance, in our example, after the swaps, `q_{+1}` ended up with the same state as `q_{-3}` originally had. This is a side effect we don't want.\n",
    "\n",
    "By directly assigning the states at the endpoints, we ensure the result is exactly what we intended: swapping only the states of qubits `i` and `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in the Swap Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Path Finding**: Using `find_path` to determine how to move between non-adjacent qubits.\n",
    "2. **Sequential Neighbor Swaps**: Performing a series of adjacent swaps to move states along the path.\n",
    "3. **Direct State Assignment**: Ensuring the final state is exactly as desired by directly setting the endpoint states.\n",
    "4. **System State Recalculation**: Maintaining consistency between individual qubit states and the full system state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method enables swapping any two qubits while respecting the physical connectivity constraints of your quantum system, which is crucial for implementing quantum algorithms on hardware with limited connectivity.\n",
